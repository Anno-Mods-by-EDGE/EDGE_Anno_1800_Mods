- Fork this repository
- Choose your language in the [modDesc Folder](https://github.com/Anno-Mods-by-EDGE/EDGE_Anno_1800_Mods) and navigating to the correct mod, and update it using the standard abbreviation for the language you are providing.

- Give it a name describing what mod it belongs to like "FS19_"Template"_modDesc_l10n_"en".xml
- Open a pull request against the `master` branch of this repository.
- Be sure to @ mention a couple of your friends who are native speakers and ask them to review the translation.
